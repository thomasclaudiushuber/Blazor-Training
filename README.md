# Blazor-Training
This repository contains the code samples for the Blazor training.

You find for every project the folders **before** and **after**. Open the project in the **before** folder, go in Visual Studio to *"View -> Task Lst"* and watch out for the TODO comments. They contain the instructions for you.

Have fun!
